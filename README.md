**Note:** Always verify the legality of downloading content from specific websites and adhere to their terms of use. Respect intellectual property rights and use any downloader tool responsibly.

**Extra Note:** Due to certain reasons, one being the dreaded cors policy, the web app doesn't really download; although it helps in making the process of downloading from the official Gogoanime site a lot less tedious

## Desktop Users Only

To make it easier to utilize this web app, I recommend installing the **Tab Groups Extension** from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-groups-extension/nplimhmoanghlebhdiboeellhgmgommi/related?utm_source=ext_sidebar&hl=en-US).

![third](./public/third.png)

Before you continue with the setup, ensure you download this [config file](./public/tabgroups_rules_20240102.json).

After installing, you can decide to pin it or not (I prefer pinning my favorite extensions).

![fourth](./public/fourth.png)

Click on the extension's icon.

![fifth](./public/fifth.png)

Click on the **Group Rules** tab.

![sixth](./public/sixth.png)

Select **Edit Rules**, you'll be redirected to a new tab with the caption **Tab Grouping Rules** on its page's body.

![seventh](./public/seventh.png)

Select **Import/Export > Import JSON File**.

![eighth](./public/eighth.png)

A file select dialog window appears, navigate to the directory where the file I instructed to be downloaded earlier is located, and select the said file.

![ninth](./public/ninth.png)

This should be the output of the current window.

![tenth](./public/tenth.png)

**Rare:** If the toggle is disabled, enable it.

### No Need To Worry About Tab Clutter Any More

Now, whenever you use the web app, all tabs related to the output will be grouped. The group can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on the group title, which should be **Gogoanime**.

You can choose to extract it to its own window.
